"What characteristic does the attiny25-45-85-design-considerations have?","The energy of a single transient pulse may be higher than an ESD pulse at the same voltage, depending on the coupling path into the system."
"What characteristic does the attiny25-45-85-design-considerations have?","The zones may be put inside each other. The noise going into and out of the innermost zone will then have to pass several layers of filters and/or shielding. The total noise reduction will then be much more efficient than what can be received by one layer. An example here is a particularly sensitive analog circuit, perhaps with its own shield, on the analog part of a PCB inside a shielded enclosure with filtered I/O connectors. Another example is a fast microcontroller with fast communication to a nearby memory, and slower communication to other parts of the system. Then the MCU and the memory can be defined as the inner zone – the noisiest part. All lines leaving this zone should then be filtered, making sure that none of them carry the highest-frequency noise further out. The next level of filters may then be on the edge of the “digital zone”, and perhaps also a third layer of filtering on the system I/O ports is used to reduce emitted noise even further. Three layers of filters may sound expensive, but three simple filters may cost much less than an advanced “one-filter-handles-all” solution."

"What is the BIT 0 of the DS3231M?","A1F: Alarm 1 flag. A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag bit indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 registers. If the A1IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, INT/SQW is also asserted. A1F is cleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leaves the value unchanged."
"What is the 3 of the DS3231M?","Active-Low Interrupt or 1Hz Square-Wave Output. This open-drain pin requires an external pullup resistor connected to a supply at 5.5V or less. It can be left open if not used. This multifunction pin is determined by the state of the INTCN bit in the Control register (0Eh). When INTCN is set to logic 0, this pin outputs a 1Hz square wave. When INTCN is set to logic 1, a match between the timekeeping registers and either of the alarm registers activates the INT/SQW pin (if the alarm is enabled). Because the INTCN bit is set to logic 1 when power is first applied, the pin defaults to an interrupt output with alarms disabled."
